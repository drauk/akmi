# akmi
Alan Kennington's Music Interpreter

This is a program written in classic C for creating MIDI files from a higher-level language called AKMI. The "user manual" for this AKMI language is built in to the program help menus. Good luck trying to read and understand them!

The akmi software was originally written to run on an Atari ST in 1989-1992, but it will also compile and run on an SLC sparc station with SunOS 4.1.3, especially if it has a very old-fashioned serial to MIDI converter fitted to one of its serial ports. This version of the software is a MIDI file translater, not a real-time MIDI stream generator.

This code compiles and runs correctly with gcc 4.5.0 on OpenSuSE linux 11.3, and now also with gcc 4.8.1 on OpenSuSE linux 13.1.
